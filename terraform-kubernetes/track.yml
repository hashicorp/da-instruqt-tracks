title: Using Terraform to Deploy to Kubernetes
teaser: |-
  Learn how to use the Kubernetes Terraform Provider to deploy to a Kubernetes
  cluster.
description: "Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure\nsafely
  and efficiently. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating\ndeployment,
  scaling, and management of containerized applications. \nBy using Terraform and
  Kubernetes, we can parametrize application deployment,\nmanage deployment configuration,
  and track differences in configuration and\nversioning.\n\nIn this track, we will
  start with using Terraform to deploy an web\napplication to a Kubernetes cluster.
  Then, we will deploy Apache Zookeeper,\nan application with additional configuration
  required, to the cluster."

  title: Verify Kubernetes cluster
  teaser: Make sure the Kubernetes cluster is running properly.
  assignment: |-
    In the Kubernetes terminal, check that Kubernetes is running using the
    command `kubectl get nodes`. There should be a single node with status
    **Ready**.

    If everything is running correctly,
    hit **check** to proceed.

      [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Containers can be grouped into logical units, scheduled onto available resources, connected through networking, and identified and tagged.

      Kubernetes leverages various constructs to logically group containers.
      Constructs include a:

      - *Pod*, which is a set of containers that share networking and storage.
      - *Deployment*, which is a set of Pods.
      - *Service*, which exposes a Deployment to discover and connect to other Deployments.

      For more information, refer to the [Kubernetes Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/) documentation.

  teaser: Initialize Terraform and download the Kubernetes provider.
  assignment: "Terraform requires initialization before any configuration can be applied.
    \n\nInitialization will...\n1. Install any required providers. See the \n   Provider
    tab to examine how the\n   provider is declared for Terraform use.\n1. Initialize
    the local state directory.\n\nRun `terraform init` in the Terraform terminal.\n\nThis
    installs the Terraform Kubernetes provider\nand creates a `.terraform` directory
    for local state management.\nWhen the provider has completed installation, hit
    **check** to continue."

      Terraform uses *providers* to interface with various APIs and exposing resources. A provider is versioned and included as part of a configuration file.

      ```hcl
      provider "kubernetes" {
        version = "~> X.X"
      }
      ```

      The [Kubernetes Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/index.html) allows Terraform to make calls to the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).
